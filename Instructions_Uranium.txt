mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

# Now it creates the Makefile inside the directory
# The build folder now contains a Makefile, and when you run make, the library will be compiled.
# After this step, the freshly built library is located at build/resources/i18n/nl_NL/LC_MESSAGES/uranium.mo and etc

# But, instead of that...
# You could leave the library as well as the include files there and reference them when compiling/linking your project. 
# Usually, you want to install them, so they are available systemwide and can be found automatically.

# This is done using>

> sudo make install

# The library should now be in /usr/local/lib, the include files in /usr/local/include.
